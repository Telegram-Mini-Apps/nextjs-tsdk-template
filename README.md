# Telegram Mini Apps Next.js Template

This template demonstrates how developers can implement a web application on the Telegram
Mini Apps platform using the following technologies and libraries:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TON Connect](https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/ton-connect/overview)
- [Telegram SDK](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#initializing-mini-apps)
- [Telegram UI](https://github.com/Telegram-Mini-Apps/TelegramUI)

> The template was created using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Therefore, it is required to use
> it for this project as well. Using other package managers, you will receive a corresponding error.

## Install Dependencies

If you have just cloned this template, you should install the project dependencies using the
command:

```Bash
pnpm install
```

## Scripts

This project contains the following scripts:

- `dev`. Runs the application in development mode.
- `dev:https`. Runs the application in development mode using self-signed SSL certificate.
- `build`. Builds the application for production.
- `start`. Starts the Next.js server in production mode.
- `lint`. Runs [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to ensure the code quality meets the required
  standards.

To run a script, use the `pnpm run` command:

```Bash
pnpm run {script}
# Example: pnpm run build
```

## Create Bot and Mini App

Before you start, make sure you have already created a Telegram Bot. Here is
a [comprehensive guide](https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/platform/creating-new-app) on how to
do it.

## Run

Although Mini Apps are designed to be opened
within [Telegram applications](https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/platform/about#supported-applications),
you can still develop and test them outside of Telegram during the development process.

To run the application in the development mode, use the `dev` script:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

After this, you will see a similar message in your terminal:

```bash
▲ Next.js 14.2.3
- Local:        http://localhost:3000

✓ Starting...
✓ Ready in 2.9s
```

To view the application, you need to open the `Local`
link (`http://localhost:3000` in this example) in your browser.

### Run Inside Telegram

Although it is possible to run the application outside of Telegram, it is recommended to develop it
within Telegram for the most accurate representation of its real-world functionality.

To run the application inside Telegram, [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) requires an HTTPS link.

This template already provides a solution.

To retrieve a link with the HTTPS protocol, consider using the `dev:https` script:

```bash
$ pnpm run dev:https

▲ Next.js 14.2.3
- Local:        https://localhost:3000

✓ Starting...
✓ Ready in 2.4s
```

Visiting the `Local` link (`https://localhost:3000` in this example) in your
browser, you will see the following warning:

![SSL Warning](assets/ssl-warning.png)

This browser warning is normal and can be safely ignored as long as the site is secure. Click
the `Proceed to localhost (unsafe)` button to continue and view the application.

Once the application is displayed correctly, submit the
link `https://127.0.0.1:3000` (`https://localhost:3000` is considered as invalid by BotFather) as
the Mini App link to [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather). Then, navigate
to [https://web.telegram.org/k/](https://web.telegram.org/k/), find your bot, and launch the
Telegram Mini App. This approach provides the full development experience.

## Deploy

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use
the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme)
from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more
details.
